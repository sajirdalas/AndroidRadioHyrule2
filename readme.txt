This is my attempt at rebuilding my previous Android Radio Hyrule listener in a less cumbersome, less buggy and better working state. A work in progress.

What it does so far:
-Play and Stop music in a separate service
-Get tags from service. UI thread shows tags on screen

Next steps:
-Download Album Art from source and show on ImageView
-Add high/low quality button
